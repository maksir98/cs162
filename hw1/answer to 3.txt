1. Is the programs output the same each time it is run? Why or why not?
No. Because it have 4 threads, each threads run concurrently.

2. Based on the program's output, do multiple threads share the same stack?
No.

3. Based on the program's output, do multiple threads have separate copies of global variables?
No.

4. Based on the program's output, what is the value of void *threadid? How does this relate to
the variable's type (void *)?
The value is 0, 1, 2, 3.

5. Using the first command line argument, create a large number of threads in pthread. Do all
threads run before the program exits? Why or why not?
Not all threads run before the program exits. Because "Any of the threads in the process calls exit(3), 
or the main thread performs a return from main(). This causes the termination of all threads in the process."
